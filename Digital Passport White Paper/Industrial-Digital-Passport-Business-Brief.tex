\textbf{Abstract.} The Industrial Digital Passport Protocol represents a significant market opportunity in blockchain-based product traceability. Using WEG S.A. as our first major customer, we demonstrate how manufacturers can achieve substantial ROI through premium pricing for verified products, compliance automation cost reductions, and enhanced customer relationships. Our platform addresses the EU Digital Product Passport mandate while creating new revenue streams through verified sustainability and predictive maintenance services. This presents a compelling investment opportunity to capture first-mover advantage in the rapidly growing global industrial traceability market.

    \item Real-time compliance substantially reduces audit costs
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\textbf{Market Size \& Timing:}
Industrial traceability market is experiencing rapid growth with strong demand for high-value industrial equipment requiring digital passports. The convergence of regulatory requirements and customer demands creates substantial market opportunity.

\section{What is a Digital Passport?}

\subsection{The Product Experience Revolution}

Imagine buying an industrial motor and receiving not just the physical product, but a **complete digital identity** that follows it throughout its entire life. This is what our Digital Passport Platform creates.

\textbf{For End Users (Product Owners):}

\textbf{Complete Product History:} Every motor, pump, or industrial equipment comes with an immutable record of its entire lifecycle - from raw materials to manufacturing, shipping, installation, and every maintenance event.

\textbf{Verified Authenticity:} Cryptographic proof that your equipment is genuine, not counterfeit, with verified supply chain origins.

\textbf{Predictive Maintenance:} Real-time insights and alerts about when your equipment needs service, preventing costly breakdowns and extending equipment life.

\textbf{Enhanced Warranty:} Instant access to complete maintenance history speeds up warranty claims and reduces disputes with manufacturers.

\textbf{Higher Resale Value:} Equipment with complete, verified history sells for premium prices in secondary markets.

\subsection{Real-World User Scenarios}

\textbf{Manufacturing Plant Manager:}
"I can scan a QR code on any motor in my facility and instantly see its complete history, scheduled maintenance, and performance predictions. No more lost paperwork or guessing when equipment needs service."

\textbf{Equipment Technician:}
"When I arrive for maintenance, the digital passport shows me exactly what parts were used, when they were installed, and what issues have occurred before. I can work faster and more effectively."

\textbf{Facility Owner:}
"When selling our building, equipment with digital passports commanded higher prices because buyers could verify everything was properly maintained and authentic."

\textbf{Compliance Officer:}
"Regulatory audits that used to take weeks now take hours. Every piece of equipment has complete, verified documentation automatically available."

\subsection{The Platform Solution}

Our blockchain platform enables any industrial manufacturer to create these digital passports for their products, providing complete lifecycle traceability that benefits everyone in the supply chain.

\textbf{Key Innovation:} Manufacturer-agnostic platform using Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) on Arbitrum, allowing multiple companies to use the same infrastructure while maintaining data privacy and competitive separation.

\section{Why End Users Choose Digital Passport Products}

\subsection{Immediate Value for Product Owners}

\textbf{Problem Solved: The "Black Box" Equipment Challenge}

Today, when you buy industrial equipment, you get a physical product with minimal documentation. Over time, maintenance records get lost, warranty information disappears, and the equipment's history becomes a mystery. This creates:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm]
    \item \textbf{Maintenance Guesswork:} Technicians waste time diagnosing issues without historical context
    \item \textbf{Warranty Disputes:} Manufacturers question maintenance history during warranty claims  
    \item \textbf{Compliance Headaches:} Auditors demand documentation that's often incomplete or missing
    \item \textbf{Resale Challenges:} Buyers hesitate to purchase equipment without verified history
    \item \textbf{Counterfeit Risk:} No reliable way to verify equipment authenticity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solution: Complete Equipment Transparency}

Digital Passport products eliminate these problems by providing:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm]
    \item \textbf{Instant Information Access:} Scan QR code â†’ complete equipment history appears
    \item \textbf{Proactive Maintenance:} System alerts when service is due based on actual usage patterns
    \item \textbf{Streamlined Warranties:} Manufacturers can instantly verify maintenance compliance
    \item \textbf{Effortless Compliance:} All documentation automatically organized and audit-ready
    \item \textbf{Premium Resale Value:} Verified equipment history commands higher market prices
    \item \textbf{Authenticity Guarantee:} Blockchain verification prevents counterfeit products
\end{itemize}
